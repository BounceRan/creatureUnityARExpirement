Creature

What is the extent of human affection for our man-made digital manifestations? This mobile app implements digital 3D creatures into the device’s camera view of our environment. So, the creature lives in our spatial physical world and can react to us. 

For now, the app has two choices for creatures, a shark and an elephant. Each animal corresponds to a physical card, that when recognized by the app, will make the animal appear. From there, the we can feed the animals or watch them sleep, chase a ball or roam around in our surroundings. Also, we can tap on the animal and learn some facts about the species’ existence. Is the animal endangered? If so, what’s the cause? How many are left on the planet? 

Eventually, we want to develop our app so that we have a larger database of creature. The creature would have a 7-day life span and lives on the same 24-hour day cycle as we do. When the app is turned off, the creature lives in a world parallel to ours, walking and living in our physical plane. When turned on, the creature follows us around, learns about our patterns and responds to our voice. 

Is the creature an exotic pet? Perhaps the app is a way to better understand a species, and contextualize its existence in connection to ours. We can examine its behaviors and interactions in our own in-home safari or zoo. 

The app is an observation on the extent of our attachment to the creature, made in our own image, only existent by our physical devices.
